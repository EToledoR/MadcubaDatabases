# MadcubaDatabases

This repository aims to hold all the tools needed to populate the software MADCUBA (https://cab.inta-csic.es/madcuba/). 

At the moment of writing the first version of this README we are populating the databases with the following data sets:

- **JPL (Jet Propulsion Laboratory) molecular spectroscopy catalog**
- **CDMS (The Cologne Database for Molecular Spectroscopy)**
- **Lille Spectroscopy Database Project**


with the scripts, files and documentation needed to populate the database of the MADCUBA software for spectral analysis.
