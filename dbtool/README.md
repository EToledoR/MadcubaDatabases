# MADCUBA DBTOOL

In order to simplify the process of generation of the MADCUBA database I have extracted the needed class from the MADCUBA core codebase and
make them compile together in a little jar file that can be then executed in any Java virtual machine regardless of the operative system 
without having to setup the MADCUBA development environment and run the execution from there.
